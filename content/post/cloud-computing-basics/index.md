- used by the organization to built and manage there own data centers internally or by the third party.
- private cloud distrubuted system that work on private infrastructure and provide the user with dynaminacally provisioning of computing resource
- Advantages

- suitable for the organization that requires a separate cloud for there personal use and data security is the first priority.
- Coustomer information protection
- Infrastureture ensuring SLA
